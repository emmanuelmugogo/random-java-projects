This is my random java practice projects repo...
i will be updating different console App projects as i go.

*Lucks Sevens
- console app asking a user for initial BET amount, then it throws two dice if the total turns to be 7 the user wins $4 else user loose $1
-the app will tell the user how many rolls were thrown before the user went broke, and their maxmum amount, and what roll they should quit to get maximum amount.

*Interest calculator
-this is a console app, ask a user for initial principal, years they want money to stay in, and interest rate, 
-then it ask the user to pick how often they want their principal to compound ie. monthly, quaterly or daily.
-then it gives the output of year number, initial principal on every year, total interest earned for a particular year and the ending principal for that year.
